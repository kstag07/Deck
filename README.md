  My approach was to first write tests that gave exactly what the user story wanted.  I found that pretty easy with the deck knowing that I wanted a new deck and that I wanted a count of 52 unique cards in it.  I over thought the creation of a card thinking that I had to draw my suit and number from arrays that had not been created.  After realizing I could just create a suit and number within my test I was able to figure it out.
